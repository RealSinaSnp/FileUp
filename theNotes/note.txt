- currently the program has an expiry in "UploadService.cs" in line 
expireAt = DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(2);
where it adds expiry to whatever expiry there is already except for admin.

- there is also an "ExpireAt" value that adds expiry to files uploaded no matter using which service (upload or image link provider)
var expireAt = DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(data.Expire <= 0 ? 5 : data.Expire);

- in "UploadCounter.cs" file we count the upload attempts and block the IP
    if the attempt count is more than 3. and the blocking continues until 
    24 hours after the first attempt from that IP.
    the blocking is removed if the program restarts
